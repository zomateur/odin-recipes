    <p>This is a great pita bread recipe I got from a friend who works at a great Greek restaurant here in my town. Slice pita in half and fill pockets with your favorite filling, or for dipping, cut into wedges and pan fry in a little olive oil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water (100 to 110 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed - divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable shortening</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a mixing bowl and allow to stand until the yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Mix in 2 cups of flour, salt, and shortening; beat for 2 minutes with a fork. Stir in as much of the remaining 1 1/2 cup flour as needed.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, kneading in more flour if dough is sticky. Form into a ball, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest in a warm area for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 equal portions; flour your hands and roll each piece into a ball. Cover dough balls with a kitchen towel and let rest for 10 minutes. Flatten the balls into rounds on a floured surface, cover with kitchen towel, and let rest 10 more minutes. Gently roll each dough ball into a circle about 6 inches in diameter on a floured surface. Place pita breads in a single layer on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the pita breads puff up, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip breads over with a spatula, return to oven, and bake 2 more minutes. Let cool on wire racks before cutting pita breads in half and gently separating tops and bottoms to form pockets for filling.</li>
    </ol>
